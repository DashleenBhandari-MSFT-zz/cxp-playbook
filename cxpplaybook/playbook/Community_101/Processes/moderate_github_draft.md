Each service area has different relations with the Product Group (PG), Authors, and Community users.  If you have an agreement or understanding with PG /Author about how to work together, the following flowchart may not be suitable.  The following flowchart assumes no formal agreement on division of labor.

For a new / active case:
 1. CXP engages first (issue has been triaged)
	 1. PG engages
		- Go to 'Monitor PG engagement' 
	 2. Community engages
 2. PG / Author engages first
	- Add triaged tag.  Add assigned-to-author tag.
	 - Go to 'Monitor PG engagement'
 3. Community engages first
	 - Triage and engage with the users.  If the user supplies an answer, thank the user and attempt to close the issue.

For an old / closed case:
Determine whether this is about the same problem

 1. New comment is about the same problem (or sufficiently related)
	 - re-open the issue in github and removed closed tag in WT 
	 - work the issue
 2. New comment is about unrelated problem
	 1. If new problem is a doc issue
		 - ask to open a new issue
	2.  New comment is a product issue
		- redirect to other forum

Monitor PG engagement:
1. If problem has been answered, follow up or close as needed
2.  If problem has not been sufficiently answered... (allow no more than 2 days without response)
		1. ...and PG continues to engage, monitor the situation
		2. ...and PG does not continue to engage, then nudge PG or pick up and work the issue
