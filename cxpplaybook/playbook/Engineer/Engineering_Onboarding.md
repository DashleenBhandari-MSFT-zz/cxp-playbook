# Engineering Onboarding and Readiness

Topic SME: [Nomita Paul](mailto:Nomita.Paul@microsoft.com)

> ## **Welcome to FastTrack for Azure**

**Please use the Dynamics 365 Talent link that you received during Onboarding from the Readiness team to track and mark your onboarding tasks.**

Review the PM/Engineer [RACI Chart](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:x:/t/AzureFastTrackCoreandExtended/EQaL6KCjo0ZKnxXhSVWC1MEBSjJ1OyJKvscAo1uYTAXZTQ?rtime=3Up_vZUl10g) that clearly defines whether a PM or Engineer or Lead is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted and/or Informed for each task throughout the customers lifecycle with FTA.  This document is the primary source of truth on best practices for **ALL** global PMs and Engineers to follow.

> ## **Readiness mission**

To onboard FTA Engineers and enable them to deliver high-quality customer engagements consistent with FTA methodology with a focus on raising their Azure proficiency, deepening Product Group collaboration and facilitating cross team knowledge sharing.

> ## **Business Value**

### Every engineer will get

- A strong and well thought thorough onboarding experience. Followed by the ability to chart their continuous learning via self-paced learning plans (Growth and upskilling)
- A community that fosters collaboration, growth, and learning.

### FTA Business will get

- Visibility into the regional availability of credentialed engineers to meet growing engagement demands  
  Clarity around hiring/training needs for FTA org (Regional Sufficiency)
- A T-shaped org that anticipates business needs and is ready following flexible learning paths.
- Future capability for segments/industry (even when they are not FTA supported yet)

### Every customer will receive

- Consistent and compelling experiences across the globe that enables them to achieve their cloud migration goals while raising their confidence in using Azure.

> ## **The engineer roadmap involves two stages:**

### **1. Onboarding**

It defines the experience of the engineer from the day you join to the day you deliver. It has two parts:

#### FTA Orientation

- Identify your core skills with FTA domain areas- App, Infra or Data
- Onboarding checklist that will help complete tasks needed by a new hire like joining all the DL&#8217;s, access to GitHub etc.
- Assignment of onboarding buddy within the first two days of joining who will assist you with getting started.
- A baseline self-assessment form to capture your current expertise with Azure technologies and your future interests.

#### Delivery Readiness

- A 30-day learning plan to ready you for your first engagement.
- Self-paced learning material
  - Shadowing
  - Reverse shadowing
  - Credentialing + Debrief

### **2. Continuous learning:**

After you have finished onboarding and got credentialed to deliver your first engagement. You will continue to repeat the Delivery readiness or credentialing process for any other engagements agreed upon with your manager. Continuous learning will involve building out a customized Learning plan aligned to FTA Solution Areas and Engagements you and your manager have identified for you. Taking advantage of the readiness options: · Flipped classroom · Hands-on lab · POC · FTA Exchange program · Bootcamp · Shadowing · Reverse shadowing · When ready to deliver an engagement, get validated by Expert team (Service Leads/Category Leads) via a lightweight process called credentialing, which is a framework for every new engineer to discover the FTA way of delivering engagements to customers.

> ## **Steps for Onboarding and Continuous Learning:**

This process is applicable only for new hires and involves two parts orientation and credentialing:

### **Step 1**

The Readiness team will send you an onboarding checklist that helps you get FTA ready. This also contains a self- assessment form. Complete this and schedule a 30 min call with the Readiness team. Your manager will assign an onboarding buddy who will help you learn the FTA way of doing things and answer any questions.

Outcome:

- Engineer self-assessment informs us of your current skill set and expertise. It also tells us where your interest lies.
- Onboarding buddy helps you with anything that you need related to getting ready to deliver.

#### **Step 2**

Collaborate with your manager to identify the engagements, you are going to deliver. This is determined by your manager based on your industry experience and output of Self-assessment.

Outcome:

- Alignment between engineer’s skills, interest and FTA business needs.
- Clarity on your learning for the next 3 to 6 months via learning plans for each engagement.

#### **Step 3 (Credentialing):**

Reach out to the Readiness PM to develop a customized learning plan to get you visibility to all assets available for each engagement. This will give you all the relevant information on the FTA way of delivering. Each customized plan will help you get delivery ready for all the engagements you have identified in step 2. You will use a three-step process to be delivery ready.

1. Execute the learning plan: Evaluate growth opportunities in the learning material against objectives and then follow through.
1. Identify and schedule shadowing opportunities with other engineers that are delivering the engagements and observe as a secondary engineer. Do a self-evaluation (with help from experts if needed) to determine if you are ready for reverse shadowing or leading the engagement as a primary engineer.
1. Schedule reverse shadowing where you deliver as the primary engineers with the &#8220;Experts team&#8221; shadowing you followed by a 30 min debrief to determine you are able to meet the FTA delivery standards (credentialed).

Outcome:

- You will be onboarded for engaging with FTA Customers. Or you may be recommended to improve on certain areas and come back for a rinse and repeat of reverse shadowing.

- Your manager will be given feedback on the outcome of the debrief.

#### **Step 4 (Continuous Learning):**

In the Step 2 of onboarding you have identified all the engagements that you are going to deliver as a part of onboarding or delivery ready for one engagement rinse and repeat Step 3 as many times as needed to get credentialed for all the remaining engagements identified with your manager. Then continue to use this to establish a cadence of staying current with the Azure changes and keeping abreast of technology.  
Work with your Readiness PM to develop your long-term learning to support your continuous learning objective(s).
