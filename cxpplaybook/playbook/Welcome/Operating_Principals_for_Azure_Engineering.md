# Operating Principals for Azure Engineering


### **Customer Focus**

We are relentlessly focused on making our customers, internal and external, happy.  When issues happen we take ownership and work tirelessly to resolve the situation.  We work with customers to make hard tradeoffs when necessary and drive to create customer satisfaction.  We continuously look for ways to improve customer experiences and offer them industry leading value.

### **Planning Philosophy**

Our focus is to ensure that we deliver against our plans. With Silicon we established a baseline for our efforts. Moving forward, with each semester (Phosphorous and beyond) our efforts will be incremental while keeping with the strategy and the long term vision. We will continue to make updates to the plans based on customer feedback & business needs.

### **Data Driven**

We create systems that support our ability to gain insights into our product and the experience of our customers.  We use data to drive important decisions rather than relying solely on gut instinct or opinion.  We create and test hypothesis using data to guide our direction.

### **Bias for Agility, Innovation, and Simplicity**

We have a unique and differentiated point of view on our product which we are constantly goal seeking to.  We constantly strive for simplicity in our designs, processes, and customer experiences. We take pride in our work and do not cut corners but are pragmatic and strive to fail fast and iterate to find the best solutions.  We learn from and incorporate industry best practices into our work.

### **Collaborative and Supportive**

We believe in helping others including our team and our partners.  We work with each other to create a powerful system free of unnecessary duplication.  Individuals drive for excellence but always with respect and in a manner that gives those around us a chance to be great.  We take ownership of issues that impact others and look for ways to unblock them.  We take pride in finding and delivering solutions where everyone wins while making necessary tradeoffs.

### **Personal Integrity**

We believe in being transparent and honest with others.  When we make a promise we can be counted on to deliver.  We take ownership of issues and work to resolve them.  We embrace feedback from others and work to improve without being defensive or making excuses.

### **COGS**

We are relentlessly focused on lowering COGS [Cost of Goods Sold] to improve margins and provide price competitive offerings to customers.  We continuously seek out opportunities to improve efficiency across all areas of the service lifecycle.  We stay abreast of the leading edge industry trends and work across organizations to develop capabilities to drive costs down.
