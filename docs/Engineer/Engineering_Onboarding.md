> ## **Welcome to CXP Community for Azure**

> ## **Readiness mission**

To onboard Community Engineers and enable them to deliver high-quality customer engagements consistent with Community methodology with a focus on raising their Azure proficiency, deepening Product Group collaboration and facilitating cross team knowledge sharing.

> ## **Business Value**

### Every engineer will get

- A strong and well thought thorough onboarding experience. Followed by the ability to chart their continuous learning via self-paced learning plans (Growth and upskilling)
- A community that fosters collaboration, growth, and learning.

### Every customer will receive

- Consistent and compelling experiences across the globe that enables them to achieve their cloud migration goals while raising their confidence in using Azure.

> ## **The engineer roadmap involves two stages:**

### **1. Onboarding**

It defines the experience of the engineer from the day you join to the day you deliver. It has two parts:

#### FTA Orientation

- Identify your core skills with CXP Community domain areas- App, Infra or Data
- Onboarding checklist that will help complete tasks needed by a new hire like joining all the DL&#8217;s, access to GitHub etc.
- Assignment of onboarding buddy within the first two days of joining who will assist you with getting started.
- A baseline self-assessment form to capture your current expertise with Azure technologies and your future interests.

#### Delivery Readiness

- A 30-day learning plan to ready you for your first engagement.
- Self-paced learning material
  - Shadowing
  - Reverse shadowing
  - Credentialing + Debrief

### **2. Continuous learning:**

After you have finished onboarding and got credentialed to deliver your first engagement. You will continue to repeat the Delivery readiness or credentialing process for any other engagements agreed upon with your manager. Continuous learning will involve building out a customized Learning plan aligned to CXP Community Solution Areas and Engagements you and your manager have identified for you. Taking advantage of the readiness options: · Flipped classroom · Hands-on lab · POC  · Bootcamp · Shadowing · Reverse shadowing · When ready to deliver an engagement, get validated by Expert team (Service Leads/Category Leads) via a lightweight process called credentialing, which is a framework for every new engineer to discover the CXP Community Engineer's way of delivering engagements to customers.

> ## **Steps for Onboarding and Continuous Learning:**

This process is applicable only for new hires and involves two parts orientation and credentialing:

### **Step 1**

The Readiness team will send you an onboarding checklist that helps you get Community Engineer ready. Your manager will assign an onboarding buddy who will help you learn the way of doing things and answer any questions.

Outcome:

- Engineer self-assessment informs us of your current skill set and expertise. It also tells us where your interest lies.
- Onboarding buddy helps you with anything that you need related to getting ready to deliver.

#### **Step 2**

Collaborate with your manager to identify the engagements, you are going to deliver. This is determined by your manager based on your industry experience and output of Self-assessment.

Outcome:

- Alignment between engineer’s skills, interest and business needs.
- Clarity on your learning for the next 3 to 6 months via learning plans for each engagement.

#### **Step 3 (Continuous Learning):**

In the Step 2 of onboarding you have identified all the forums that you are going to work as a part of onboarding. Then continue to use this to establish a cadence of staying current with the Azure changes and keeping abreast of technology.  
Work with your Readiness team to develop your long-term learning to support your continuous learning objective(s).
