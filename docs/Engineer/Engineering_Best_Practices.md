# Engineering Best Practices

> ## Engineer Tips and Important Guidance

**IMPORTANT**:

- Always include the field team (account or partner) on customer communications (emails or meetings). This needs to be part of our rhythm as the field will be fairly frustrated if we don't keep them in the loop.
- If partners are involved, do NOT forget to invite them.
- FastTrack for Azure has a policy that we do not record any of our customer sessions (whether scoping, check ins, deliveries, etc….)
- Always be sure to record your customer call time in Ceres under Customer (Nom) Activities.

**TIP**

- Prioritize meeting time based on the customers availability.
- Utilize FindTime for scheduling meetings (you have to download an add-in for outlook but it's really quick).
- Utilize @Cortana for scheduling meeetings.  Using [Cortana Calendar Help To Schedule Meetings.pptx](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/teams/ATinkerersNotebook/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7BEEFE88D6-9147-4A57-AE6A-06E2F18B4288%7D&file=Using%20Cortana%20Calendar%20Help%20To%20Schedule%20Meetings.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true&DefaultItemOpen=1)
- Be mindful of the time zones for attendees. [www.worldtimebuddy.com](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/)
- Join Teams meetings at least 2 mins early, to make sure everything is working
- Be ready for note taking. Open Ceres and OneNote and navigate to the correct customer.
- Make sure you have access to [Azure Support Center](../Tools&Reports/Support_Escalation.md)(to do this, go to [MyAccess Home](https://myaccess/identityiq), "request access" and In the search dialog, look for 19126 and you should see “AzureSupportCenter Product Group Access”.
- Scheduling calls back to back to back is not good practice. Block breaks on your calendar throughout the day so you have time for snack and/or bio breaks.
