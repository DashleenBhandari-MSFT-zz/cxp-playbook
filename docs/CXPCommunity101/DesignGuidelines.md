# Design Guidlines

>## **Audience**

This **Microsoft internal only** playbook is for Azure CXP Community team members and is **Microsoft Confidential**

>## **Business Requirement Document**


A Business Requirement Document (BRD) focuses on the business perspective as it holds the details of the business solution for a project. Business requirements document also emphasizes on the needs and expectations of the customer. In simpler terms, BRD indicates what the business wants to achieve. The BRD indicates all the project deliverable and the inputs and outputs associated with each process function.

>## **Story Lining of the BRD and Persona creation**

Once the BRD is created it needs to be broken down to user stories. A user story can be described as a high-level statement of a requirement that does not go into excessive detail. It describes the functionality or feature that a product is expected to deliver to the user. Stories encourage iterative development and can be refined as many times as possible to reach agreement and understanding among stakeholders.

>## **Architecture document**

The Software Architecture Document provides a comprehensive architectural overview of the system, using a number of different architectural views to depict different aspects of the system.
It serves as a communication medium between the software architect and other project team members regarding architecturally significant decisions which have been made on the project.
The representation and objectives of the software architecture is usually something that must be defined before the very first iterations, and then be maintained throughout the project.

>## **Tech Stack Discussion & Team On-Boarding**

Before starting any DEV project , we need to decide for the technology stack. Also we needs to work on the team on-boarding as longs as we are clear with requirement.

>## **Backlog Grooming**
Backlog grooming, also referred to as backlog refinement or story time, is a recurring event for agile product development teams. The primary purpose of a backlog grooming session is to ensure the next few sprints worth of user stories in the product backlog are prepared for sprint planning. Regular backlog grooming sessions also help ensure the right stories are prioritized and that the product backlog does not become a black hole.

>## **Defining Minimum Viable Product**
An MVP is a minimal form of your product that is tested on the market. This development strategy allows your team to validate (or invalidate) product assumptions and learn how your target users react and experience your product’s core functionality. This approach will provide insight into properly allocating your budget to satisfy your overall business objectives. Building an MVP is an iterative process designed to identify user pain points and determine the appropriate product functionality to address those needs over time.

>## **Sprint Planning - (Recursive event)**
Sprint planning is a timeboxed working session that lasts roughly 1 hour for every week of a sprint. In sprint planning, the entire team agrees to complete a set of product backlog items. This agreement defines the sprint backlog and is based on the team’s velocity or capacity and the length of the sprint.

>## **System Analysis (Recursive Event)**

Systems analysis is a process of collecting factual data, understand the processes involved, identifying problems and recommending feasible suggestions for improving the system functioning. This involves studying the business processes, gathering operational data, understand the information flow, finding out bottlenecks and evolving solutions for overcoming the weaknesses of the system so as to achieve the organizational goals. System Analysis also includes subdividing of complex process involving the entire system, identification of data store and manual processes.

>## **Designing User Story(Recursive event)**

Based on the user requirements and the detailed analysis of a new system, the new system must be designed. This is the phase of system designing. It is the most crucial phase in the development of a system. The logical system design arrived at as a result of system analysis and is converted into physical system design. In the design phase the SDLC process continues to move from the what questions of the analysis phase to the how . The logical design produced during the analysis is turned into a physical design - a detailed description of what is needed to solve original problem. Input, output, databases, forms, codification schemes and processing specifications are drawn up in detail. In the design stage, the programming language and the hardware and software platform in which the new system will run are also decided. Data structure, control process, equipment source, workload and limitation of the system, Interface, documentation, training, procedures of using the system, taking backups and staffing requirement are decided at this stage.

>## **Development (Recursive Event)**

When a programmer, network engineer and/or database developer are brought on to do the major work on the project. This work includes using a flow chart to ensure that the process of the system is properly organized. The development phase marks the end of the initial section of the process. Additionally, this phase signifies the start of production. The development stage is also characterized by instillation and change.

>## **Software Architecture & Component Design Guidelines**

Development and Testing Best Practices
Testing (Recursive event)
Before actually implementing the new system into operations, a test run of the system is done removing all the bugs, if any. It is an important phase of a successful system. After codifying the whole programs of the system, a test plan should be developed and run on a given set of test data. The output of the test run should match the expected results. Sometimes, system testing is considered as a part of implementation process.

Using the test data following test run are carried out:

Program test
System test
Deployment (Recursive Event)
After having the user acceptance of the new system developed, the implementation phase begins. Implementation is the stage of a project during which theory is turned into practice. The major steps involved in this phase are:

Acquisition and Installation of Hardware and Software
Conversion
User Training
Documentation
