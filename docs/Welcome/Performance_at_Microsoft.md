>## Measuring Impact

At Microsoft, Impact - Not Activity - is what Matters Most. In Microsoft's Performance and Development Approach, "Performance" is defined as "Impact."
Impact is:

- Measured through Core Priorities and Critical Indicators of Success
- Guided through Connects, which are regular discussions between a Manager and employee.
- Determined with the support of benchmarks, which provide an objective framework for how Managers and leaders will evaluate impact.
- Recognized through rewards.

Information at Microsoft is fluid and ever-changing. For the most up-to-date information about our approach to performance it's recommended you check [HRweb](http://hrweb/Pages/default.aspx).

## Impact is a Combination of Three Things

![Three things that make up Impact](../images/WelcomeImages/ThreePartsofImpact.png)

1. Individual accomplishments that contribute to the team, business, or customer in such a way that the accomplishments moved the team, the product, the customer, and the company **forward**.
1. Personal contributions that lead to the success of others (being willing to set down your own work and help someone else). This is a measure of the **impact an employee has on broader results by constructively sharing their successes, misses, ideas, and inputs with others.**
1. The leveraging and building on ideas of others - your **results that build on the work**, ideas or effort of others. Connective with others and leveraging their successes misses, inputs and ideas to **maximize the collective impact** against a set of shared priorities.

>## Connects and core priorities

Setting your **Core Priorities** is an important part of your career at Microsoft. Your Core Priorities are your three to five primary, long-term accountabilities. They include your primary areas of focus and the impact of each on the team, business, or customer. Your Core Priorities align your role with your team, department or organization, and the overall business objectives of your group.

Your **Connects** provide you and your Manager with business-aligned opportunities to have meaningful discussions with your Manager about what you've accomplished in the last few months and what you have planned for the next few months ahead. Connects help employees and Managers to understand the impact the employee is having on team, business, and customer results and to identify opportunities to have even greater impact going forward.

One of your key goals over your first 30 days is to develop and submit your Core Priorities for your new role. You will need to work closely with your Manager to determine what your Core Priorities will be. Your Buddy Mentor can also help to guide you during this process by sharing his or her Core Priorities with you (especially if they are similar or shared among members of your team) and by providing answers to questions you may have.

### **Steps to Setting Your Core Priorities**

1. Your Manager will share his or her Core Priorities with you. Work with your Manager to determine which of these Core Priorities, or elements of the Core Priorities, will be shared with you.
1. Work with your Manager to understand which Core Priorities you will share with other team members or stakeholders and which ones are unique to your role
1. Once you and your Manager have agreed on your Core Priorities, record them in the [Connect](https://msconnect.microsoft.com/) tool.

[About Connects](http://hrweb/career/performance/Connects/Pages/aboutconnects.aspx) - Learn about the intent behind Connect Discussions, get guidance on identifying Core Priorities and filling out a Connect.

[Sample Connects](http://hrweb/career/performance/Connects/Pages/sampleconnects.aspx) - Use these sample completed Connects to give you a sense of what types of things to include when completing your own Connect.
